RBIOM is under very active development. 

Planned feature improvements are publicly catalogued at the main RBIOM development site on github; specifically on the ["Issues" page for biom-format](https://github.com/biom-format/biom-format/issues)

If the feature you are hoping for is not listed, you are welcome to add it as a feature request "issue" on this page. This request will be publicly available and listed on the page.

Meanwhile, the R-code branch has not been merged with the master biom-format branch just yet, and consequently, it doesn't seem quite appropriate to post issues that no one else can yet work on until I've submitted the pull request.

TO DO before merge:

- Added some tests within R package
- Add the relevant test command into the top-level test script
- Add example code to "examples" section in function-level documentation.
- More-clearly document the BIOM class.
