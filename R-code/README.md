# R-code

This upper level R-code directory is a place for R examples and R support scripts for the other BIOM tools. The R package for interfacing with the BIOM format is contained within another level lower, called "RBIOM".

Some more details:

 * Should add To-Dos in the official Issues list for biom-format

 * Use roxygen2 for building documentation of the RBIOM package

 * Plan to release RBIOM in Bioconductor, once it is ready.
